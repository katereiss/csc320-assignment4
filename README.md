Option #2: Capture Grade Statistics Using For-loop
Write a program that will provide important statistics for the grades in a class. The program will utilize a for-loop to read ten floating-point grades from user input. Include code to prevent an endless loop. Ask the user to enter the values, then print the following data:

-Average
-Maximum
-Minimum

Compile and submit your pseudocode, source code, and screenshots of the application executing the application, the results and GIT repository in a single document.
